This repository presents the first version of a plugin that integrates Hyperledger Fabric with the Fogbed emulation environment. Based on examples from the fabric-samples repository, this repository provides a starting point that was essential for the development of a more flexible version.

**Note:** This repository is deprecated. Please use [Plugin V2](https://github.com/AndrezaNobrega/fabric-python-plugin) for the latest version.
